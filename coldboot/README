This directory contains files used to build coldboot.bin and pilot.bin, helper firmware used in uploading programs to the Rabbit.

Uploading via Openrabbit is a multi-stage process (similar to Dynamic)

* Put Rabbit into cold-bootmode
* Load initial loader (coldboot.bin) in triplet format at 2400 bps
* Run initial loader to load secondary loader (pilot.bin) at 57600 bps
* Run secondary loader to load user program

The files in this directory are derived from Dynamic C 9.62 (https://github.com/digidotcom/DCRabbit_9) and covered by the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.

* makecold: Utility to convert binary to triplet form
* makecold.cpp: Source for above
* coldboot.bin: initial loader
* coldboot.s: Source for above
* pilot.bin: Secondary loader
* pilot.c: Source for above (to be compiled with Dynamic C for now, should be converted to compile with SDCC)
