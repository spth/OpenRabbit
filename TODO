- Get it working, make 0.1.2 release.
- Merge coldboot branch (for free coldload.bin), make 0.2.0 release.
- Do some minor polishing (coldload.s, the program itself), make 0.2.1 release.

- Translate pilot.c to SDCC
- proper error handling (instead of exiting we should retry and/or report)
- implement the watch window 
- fix struct dependancy
- make a gdb compatible interface, so kdevelop or motor can be used?
- Merge this work into OpenOCD? That way, we'd automatically get the gdb compatible interface.
