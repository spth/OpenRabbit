What is OpenRabbit?

A free portable replacement for the Digi Rabbit Field Utility and an on-target debugger. This allows Rabbit development on OSes other than Windows. The on-target debugger currently only works with programs created using the non-free Dynamic C (which can be run .e.g via wine).

History:

OpenRabbit was developed and maintained by Lourens Rozema. The latest release was 0.1.1.
The original homepage can be found at http://www.lourensrozema.nl/index.php/openrabbit.inc

This repository has been created by Philipp Klaus Krause (with endorsement by Lourens Rozema) to continue development.
