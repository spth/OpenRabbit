What is OpenRabbit?

A free portable replacement for the Digi Rabbit Field Utility and an on-target debugger. This allows Rabbit development on OSes other than Windows. The on-target debugger currently only works with programs created using the non-free Dynamic C (which can be run .e.g via wine).

A free inital loader (coldload.bin) and secondary loader (pilot.bin) are included in OpenRabbit, but it will also work with loader binary blobs from Dynamic C 8 or 9.

See BUILD for how to build it.

Use:

OpenRabbit supports two modes:

* Rabbit Field utility mode, invoke as "openrabbitfu". Flashing only. Works with files from any source, including SDCC and Dynamic C.
* OpenRabbit mode, invoke as "openrabbit". Debugging support. Requires files from Dynamic C.

Example:

    openrabbitfu --dc8pilot coldload.bin pilot.bin user.bin /dev/ttyUSB0

Will upload the user program user.bin onto the target via cable attached to /dev/ttyUSB0 and using initial loader coldload.bin, secondary loader pilot.bin (with the secondary loader in Dynamic C 8 format).

Options:

--help     Showusage information summary.
--verbose  Increase verbosity (this option can be used up to 3 times, with each additional use increasing verbosity).
--slow     Workaround for tcdrain() driver bugs (see below)

Serial cable with USB-to-serial convverter:

The use of a serial cable with an external USB-to-serial converter can be problematic. Most, but not all of them work when using the --slow option.

History:

OpenRabbit was initially developed and maintained by Lourens Rozema. His latest release was 0.1.1.
