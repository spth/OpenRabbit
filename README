What is OpenRabbit?

A free portable replacement for the Digi Rabbit Field Utility and an on-target debugger. This allows Rabbit development on OSes other than Windows. The on-target debugger currently only works with programs created using the non-free Dynamic C (which can be run .e.g via wine).

It requires the use of a binary blob: The secondary loader (pilot.bin).
The one from Dynamix C 8.61 works with Openrabbit.
The pilot.bin from Dynamic C 9.62A does not work.

The inital loader (coldload.bin) is included in OpenRabbit.
