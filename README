What is OpenRabbit?

A free portable replacement for the Digi Rabbit Field Utility and an on-target debugger. This allows Rabbit development on OSes other than Windows. The on-target debugger currently only works with programs created using the non-free Dynamic C (which can be run .e.g via wine).

A free inital loader (coldload.bin) and secondary loader (pilot.bin) are included in OpenRabbit.

Build (including initial loader - requires SDCC):

./configure
make

Build (without initial loader):

./configure --disable-coldboot

Use:

Alternatively, OpenRabbit also works with the coldload.bin from Dynmaic C 8 or 9, the pilot.bin from Dynamic C 9 (and the pilot.bin from Dynamic C 8 if pilotoffset is adjusted in rabbit.c).

OpenRabbit supports two modes:

* Rabbit Field utility mode, invoke as "openrabbitfu". Flashing only. Works with files from any source, including SDCC and Dynamic C.
* OpenRabbit mode, invoke as "openrabbit". Debugging support. Requires files from Dynamic C.
