What is OpenRabbit?

A free portable replacement for the Digi Rabbit Field Utility and an on-target debugger. This allows Rabbit development on OSes other than Windows. The on-target debugger currently only works with programs created using the non-free Dynamic C (which can be run .e.g via wine).

A free inital loader (coldload.bin) and secondary loader (pilot.bin) are included in OpenRabbit, but it will also work with loader binary blobs from Dynamic C.

Build (including initial loader - requires SDCC):

./configure
make

Build (without initial loader):

./configure --disable-coldboot

Use:

OpenRabbit supports two modes:

* Rabbit Field utility mode, invoke as "openrabbitfu". Flashing only. Works with files from any source, including SDCC and Dynamic C.
* OpenRabbit mode, invoke as "openrabbit". Debugging support. Requires files from Dynamic C.

Warning: Openrabbit does not really work yet with the included secondary loader pilot.bin or a secondary loader from Dynamic C 9!
Use secondary loader pilot.bin from Dynamic C 8 with --dc8pilot option for reliable operation!

Example:

openrabbitfu --dc8pilot coldload.bin pilot.bin user.bin /dev/ttyUSB0

Will upload the user program user.bin onto the target via cable attached to /dev/ttyUSB0 and using initial loader coldload.bin, secondary loader pilot.bin (with the secondary loader in Dynamic C 8 format).

History:
